# project-final-team 2

Final project repo for INFO 523 - Fall 2025. 
   
This project utilizes data mining and a subset of the Million Song Dataset (MSD), a large-scale collection of audio features and metadata for one million contemporary popular music tracks to try to answer two questions from the dataset:  
1. Can we accurately classify a song’s genre using its extracted audio features?
2. What audio and metadata features are most predictive of a song’s popularity (song_hotttnesss)?
